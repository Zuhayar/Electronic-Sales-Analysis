-- Assuming we have two tables: 'employees' and 'departments'

-- Inner Join: Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.
SELECT * 
FROM employees 
INNER JOIN departments 
ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;

-- Left Join: Returns all rows from the left table (employees), and the matched rows from the right table (departments). If there is no match, the result is NULL.
SELECT * 
FROM employees 
LEFT JOIN departments 
ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;

-- Right Join: Returns all rows from the right table (departments), and the matched rows from the left table (employees). If there is no match, the result is NULL.
SELECT * 
FROM employees 
RIGHT JOIN departments 
ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;

-- Full Join: Returns all rows when there is a match in either left or right table. If there is no match, the result is NULL.
SELECT * 
FROM employees 
FULL JOIN departments 
ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;

-- Cross Join: Returns the Cartesian product of the two tables, meaning it returns all possible combinations of rows from both tables. (No ON clause needed)
SELECT * 
FROM employees 
CROSS JOIN departments;
